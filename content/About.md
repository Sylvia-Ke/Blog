I'm a curious soul with a love for blending medicine, technology, and creativity. 

As a non-traditional medical student with a first degree in chemical engineering, I’ve embraced the journey of exploring multiple passions. Right now, I’m diving into the world of AI and teaching myself Python in my spare time. 

This blog is my space to share the ups, downs, and breakthroughs as I document my learning journey and dream of building innovative solutions at the intersection of health and tech.
